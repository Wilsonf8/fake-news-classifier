      "It all hit the fan on the final \"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" reunion episode Sunday night, as Kandi Burruss finally confronted Phaedra Parks for her role in spreading a vicious rape rumor. All season long, Burruss has been fighting allegations she and husband Todd said they wanted to drug co-star Porsha Williams and take advantage of her. Last week, Porsha revealed she first heard about it from Parks, who claimed she heard it from Kandi firsthand. \"To say I would drug somebody, there's multiple levels to that,\" an emotional Burruss said to Phaedra during the reunion. \"She, as a person who knows me, knows I don't do drugs or deal with anything with drugs, but then on top of that, as an attorney why would you repeat to say somebody would drug somebody?\" \"People was under my comments with the hashtag #KandiAKABillCosby,\" she continued. \"Y'all know how much I care about my business and my brand and you're gonna sit up there and say some shit like that? It's one thing to say she messed with this person, we throw shade, whatever, but drugs?\" \"You should understand that drugging somebody while they're drinking is rape,\" she added, starting to cry. \"Y'all accused me of being a f--king rapist, that is crazy. You as an attorney, why would you do that?!\" She then walked off the set. Parks and Williams had a heated talk of their own backstage, as Porsha asked why Phaedra claimed Kandi had told her about her alleged plan. \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have repeated it. I didn't know,\" said Parks. \"If something would have happened to you, I would have been a bad friend.\" \"You have to understand how f--ked up this is and how f--ked up I been looking staying by your side,\" Williams shot back. \"You gotta give me some answers, because what I feel is you used me as a pawn against Kandi and that's why my heart is sunken right now. They ain't ever said nothing to deserve no shit like that and you know it.\" I'm sorry. I shouldn't have repeated it,\" Phaedra added. \"I mean I'm sorry. Hell, I didn't know if it was true or not.\" \"I f--king asked was it true. Don't tell me like it's the truth,\" said Williams. When the women all sat back down again together, Porsha apologized to Kandi. \"I'm here to be direct and I'm here to say that I am very, very upset for being used as a pawn,\" said Williams. \"I feel horrible. From me, I am apologizing to you.\" Cohen then addressed Parks, saying she got caught in a \"megawatt lie.\" \"What more can I do? I apologized already and the person I'm most concerned about is Porsha,\" Parks said. \"I'm sorry that it hurt Kandi as well.\" Burruss previously told TooFab things between her and the two women were \"unrepairable.\" \"It's definitely unrepairable at this point. In the past, I felt like it was repairable, but every time I would try to reach out to try to get some type of positive growth, they would do something else,\" she explained. \"It just got the point now where I'm like no, it's so not repairable, it's so broken at this point, I feel like we need to just stop talking about each other period. At this point, we're not going to be friends, so let's just stop.\" \n",

Blake Shelton left his girlfriend of two years Gwen Stefani high and dry when he dumped her before heading off on tour in February, In Touch has exclusively learned, and she’s not taking it well. “Gwen doesn’t know what hit her,” said the insider. “She’s heartbroken.” But wait, Gwen just posted a photo with Blake three days ago, so what gives? Apparently, it’s a desperate attempt to ignore the truth. “She continues to send him loving social media support from LA while he’s been out on the road,” said another insider. “But Blake has drastically slowed regular communication with her.” He certainly hasn’t reciprocated her online affection.  @blakeshelton have a good show tonight we r missing u in L.A.❤️ gx A post shared by  Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 1, 2018 at 3:52pm PST “Blake’s through with Gwen’s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women,” explained the source. Apparently, Gwen was jealous over his closeness with The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski, and Blake got sick of trying to make her trust him. “She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.” “Blake told Gwen that he was going to be doing the latter part of the monthlong Country Freaks Tour without her,” said the source. “Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended. After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.” Watch the video below to look back at the couple in happier times. Even worse, Blake has been looking for solace with newly-single ex-wife Miranda Lambert! “Miranda reached out to Blake via text,” said the insider. “Ultimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships. They’ve become close friends and allies over the past month or so. They have developed into close confidantes and are sharing intimate details of their lives.” We can only imagine how Gwen would feel about that.

      "Amber Rose is reminding her Rosebuds that she's still single! Since splitting with Val Chmerkovskiy in February, rumors have been swirling that the model has sparked up a romantic relationship with rapper French Montana. Although the two were all smiles in the pics and videos posted from a birthday they attended, their captions seemed to say it all -- they're more like family. WATCH: Val Chmerkovskiy Addresses Amber Rose Split for the First Time On Saturday, Rose and French both took to Instagram to share highlights from hip-hop artist Belly's birthday bash. In one of the videos, the former Dancing With the Stars contestant lays her head on French's chest, flirting with the camera. \"My bruvaaa @frenchmontana,\" she captioned it. \"??? straight ???#UNFORGETTABLE.\" \"Happy Birthday @belly,\" another post read, which featured MUVA rocking a bright orange dress as she posed with the birthday boy and Basketball Wives star Duffey. And according to a snap posted by French, Drake later joined in on the party, too! Earlier this month, Rose and French initiated renewed romance rumors when the two both posted the same sexy pic to Instagram. Rose's post remains on her page with the caption \"my muf**kin Bruva,\" while the rapper has since deleted his (though, to be fair, he did undergo a major social media clean-up in order to put full focus on his new single, \"Unforgettable\").

WAGS Miami stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler are married. The newlyweds tied the knot during a romantic beachside wedding in Curacao on Sunday, May 14, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm.  The Atlanta Falcons linebacker, 32, and reality star exchanged vows at sunset before some 100 guests. “I really wanted to pick a place that no one I knew had been before … so it would be an experience not just for me and Phil, but for everyone,” Roberts told Us of the location ahead of their big day. “The island is close to Aruba, but closer to Venezuela and South America and it’s only a two-hour flight from Miami. It was perfect.” The bride wore two dresses for her big day: During the ceremony she opted for a Milady-designed mermaid gown, which featured bling everywhere, and for the reception, she changed into a Lena Bernisha-designed dress with a detachable train.  “I wanted to be able to dance the night away,” Roberts told Us.  Their beach-glam wedding also featured lots of candles and gold touches.  “Everything is very formal beach glamour, it’s a beach wedding, but still very glam,” Roberts told Us of her vision. “Lots of bling, candles everywhere and gold touches.” You have successfully subscribed.

The show also features performances by Dancing with the Stars Juniors host Jordan Fisher, the kid pros and kid stars! Here's a recap of Disney Night, including the scores and what judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman, and Bruno Tonioli had to say about all the magical Disney Night performances.

Grocery Store Joe & Jenna: \"Go Joe!\" said Carrie Ann. \"That was a vast improvement!\" She complimented Joe for not missing any steps.

      "Documents reportedly show the pop idol who died last month aged 67 left his $150,000 (£111,000) assets to son while his three half-siblings were left ‘music memorabilia’ DAVID Cassidy has completely snubbed his daughter Katie Cassidy in his will, it has been revealed. Instead, the late actor and musician, who shot to fame as Keith in 1970s TV sitcom The Partridge Family, reportedly left most of his estate to his son Beau. Documents obtained by The Blast show the pop idol, who died last month aged 67, left his $150,000 (£111,000) assets to Beau, while his three half-siblings were left \"music memorabilia\". But the star made it clear that he did not want to leave any of his assets to his daughter Katie, who was by his side when he died. He wrote: “It is my specific intent not to provide any benefits hereunder to Katherine Evelyn Cassidy.” The will was drafted in 2004. Originally it named his then-wife Susan as personal representative, but the role fell to his cousin following their 2016 divorce.   Following her dad’s death, devastated Katie shared her father’s last words, writing on Twitter: “Words cant express the solace our family’s received from all the love & support during this trying time.  \"My father’s last words were ‘so much wasted time’. “This will be a daily reminder for me to share my gratitude with those I love as to never waste another minute… thank you.” But David and his daughter revealed in an interview with People earlier this year that he was merely her father by biology.
